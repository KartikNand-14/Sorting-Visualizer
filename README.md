# Sorting-Visualizer

This project is a web-based sorting visualizer that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. It provides a graphical representation of how different sorting algorithms manipulate data to sort it efficiently.

## Features

- Visualization of sorting algorithms including:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Heap Sort
- Adjustable speed control for visualization
- Random array generation for sorting

## Usage

1. Upon opening `index.html` in your web browser, you will see a visual representation of an unsorted array of bars.
2. Choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
3. Click the "Sort" button to start the visualization.
4. Use the slider to adjust the speed of the visualization.
5. Click the "Randomize Array" button to generate a new random array for sorting.

## Algorithms

This project implements the following sorting algorithms:

- **Bubble Sort**: Simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
- **Merge Sort**: Divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively splits the array and merges the sorted halves.
- **Quick Sort**: Divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot and partitions the array into smaller sub-arrays.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time by inserting each item into its correct position.
- **Heap Sort**: Builds a max heap and repeatedly extracts the maximum element to sort the array.
